What is the return value of each_with_object in the following code? Why?

['ant', 'bear', 'cat'].each_with_object({}) do |value, hash|
  hash[value[0]] = value
end

So we are passing a hash argument into the each_with_object method. Then we are passing a block iterating through each value. I believe the second argument in the block is the name of the hash in this case.

now its saying hash[ant[0]] = ant

Need to come back to this because I am not sure how hash[value[0]] is equal to a:


Figured it out. hash in this case is a name for the argument in the method. In this case {} = hash, now we can use hash as a dummy name for {}.

so hash == to {}

now we are looking for the value at index 0 for item one in our array. so index 0 for item ant == a 

a since we are creating a hash basically become the key.

"a"

Now we are saying that that index 0 which is a is connected to that value in this case ant

so we created a hash {"a" => "ant"}
