1. Ask the user certain information like loan amount, apr, and loan duration. Store these values for later use. 
2. need to calculate monthly interest rate from apr. Loan duration in months

3. Formula to use: m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))


START 
SET loan_amount = user input
IF loan amount is a real number
break
else PRINT thats not a valid number

^^^ some type of looping construct

SET annual_rate = user input
IF annual_rate is a real number
break
else PRINT thats not a valid number

^^^ some type of looping construct

SET monthly_rate = annual_rate / 100 / 12

SET loan_duration = user input (require it in months)
IF loan_duration is a real number
break
else PRINT thats not a valid number

^^^ some type of looping construct

SET monthly_payment = loan_amount * (monthly_rate / (1 - (1 + monthly_rate)**(-loan_duration)))
