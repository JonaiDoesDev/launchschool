P: Understandin the PROBLEM

Three steps:

1. Read the problem description.
2. Check the test cases, if any.
3. If any part of the problem is unclear, ask the interviewer or problem requester to clarify the matter.

E: EXAMPLE:

# PROBLEM:

# Given a string, write a method change_me which returns the same
# string but with all the words in it that are palindromes uppercased.

# change_me("We will meet at noon") == "We will meet at NOON"
# change_me("No palindromes here") == "No palindromes here"
# change_me("") == ""
# change_me("I LOVE my mom and dad equally") == "I LOVE my MOM and DAD equally"


input: string
output: string (not the same object)
rules: 
      explicit requirements:
       - every palindrome in the string must be converted to uppercase. (Reminder: palindome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards.)
       - Palindromes are case sensitive ("Dad" is not a palindrome, but "dad" is.)

       implicit requirements:
       - the returned string shouldn't be the same string object.
       - if the string is an empty string, the result should be an empty string.
